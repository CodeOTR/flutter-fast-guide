## Update the CLI
To update the CLI, simply activate it again:

```
dart pub global activate flutter_fast_cli
```

Once the CLI is updated, you can check the version by [listing your active Dart packages](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-global#listing-active-packages). The package version will be next to the `flutter_fast_cli` name:

```
dart pub global list

...

flutter_fast_cli 1.0.1
```
