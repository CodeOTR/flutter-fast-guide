The Flutter Fast CLI generates Flutter code for a variety of tech stacks. In order for it to run properly, you'll need to set up the peripheral tools and platforms.

We currently support the following tools (with more planned to come):
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/)
- [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/)
- [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/)
