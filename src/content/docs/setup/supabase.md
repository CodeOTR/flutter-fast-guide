Create a Supabase account and project: https://supabase.com/

After creating your Supabase project, add the following variables to your `config.json` file:

```
"SUPABASE_URL": "",
"SUPABASE_ANON_KEY": ""
```
The SUPABASE_URL value can be found in the dashboard here:

All Projects -> {Your Project} -> Project Settings -> API -> Project URL

The SUPABASE_ANON_KEY value can be found on the same page:

All Projects -> {Your Project} -> Project Settings -> API -> Project API keys (anon public)

The [Flutter setup steps](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/quickstarts/flutter) will be completed by the Flutter Fast CLI.
