The Flutter Fast CLI generates Flutter code for a variety of tech stacks. In order for it to run properly, you'll need to set up the peripheral tools and platforms.

We currently support the following tools:
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/)
- [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/)
- [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/)
- [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/)
